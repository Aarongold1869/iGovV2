    <p><em>The following is a guest post by Jacquelyn Deppe, an intern with the Digital Resources Division of the Law Library of Congress. She is a graduate student of the <a href="https://comminfo.rutgers.edu/graduate-and-professional-programs/master-information">Masters of Information</a> program at <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a>. International Coffee Day is celebrated in the United States on September 29, and internationally on October 1.</em></p> <p>According to the <a href="http://www.ico.org/ica2007.asp">International Coffee Organization</a> &#8220;there are more than 25 million small coffee farmers and their families who produce 70% of the world&#8217;s coffee and are particularly affected by fluctuations in market prices and imbalances in supply and demand.&#8221; Fluctuations can be caused by several factors, as was the case in the 1940s.</p> <p>During World War II, the closure of European coffee markets gave rise to&#xA0;widespread panic. While those in Latin America feared the continuing decline in coffee prices, the United States worried the drop would turn Latin American countries to Nazism or Communism.</p> <p>In order ease the fears of both regions, the multilateral <a href="//www.loc.gov/law/help/us-treaties/bevans/m-ust000003-0671.pdf?loclr=bloglaw">Inter-American Coffee Agreement</a>&#xA0;was signed on November 28, 1940, by the governments of <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/brazil.php?loclr-bloglaw">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/colombia.php?loclr=bloglaw">Colombia</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/costarica.php?loclr=bloglaw">Costa Rica</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/cuba.php?loclr=bloglaw">Cuba</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/dominican.php?loclr=bloglaw">the Dominican Republic</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/ecuador.php?loclr=bloglaw">Ecuador</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/elsalvador.php?loclr=bloglaw">El Salvador</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/guatemala.php?loclr=bloglaw">Guatemala</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/haiti.php?loclr=bloglaw">Haiti</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/honduras.php?loclr=bloglaw">Honduras</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/mexico.php?loclr=bloglaw">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/nicaragua.php?loclr=bloglaw">Nicaragua</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/peru.php?loclr=bloglaw">Peru</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/us.php?loclr=bloglaw">the United States of America</a>, and <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/venezuela.php?loclr=bloglaw">Venezuela</a>.</p> <p>The Inter-American Coffee Agreement established quotas for coffee-producing countries involved in the agreement in an &#8220;effort to promote the orderly marketing of coffee in international trade, with a view to assure equitable terms for both producers and consumers by adjusting supply to demand.&#8221; (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/us-treaties/bevans/m-ust000003-0671.pdf?loclr=bloglaw">Inter-American Coffee Agreement, preamble, Nov. 28, 1940, 55 Stat. 1143, 1146</a>.)</p> <p>While this agreement expired in 1948, it would not be the last time an agreement on coffee would be made under similar circumstances. In 1962, during the Cold War, the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XIX-4&amp;chapter=19&amp;clang=_en">International Coffee Agreement</a> and the <a href="http://www.ico.org/">International Coffee Organization</a> were created &#8220;because of the <a href="http://www.ico.org/mission07_e.asp?section=About_Us">great economic importance of coffee</a>.&#8221; The new agreement was negotiated at the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/">United Nations</a> headquarters in <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/states/us-ny.php?loclr=bloglaw">New York</a>, once again involving the United States of America, Latin American countries, and other coffee-producing countries from around the world.</p> <p><div id="attachment_76075" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/89714486/"><img class="wp-image-76075 size-full" src="//blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/10/coffee.jpg" alt=" Black and white photograph of farm workers picking coffee beans along irrigation ditches in Singapore." width="640" height="441" srcset="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/10/coffee.jpg 640w, https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/10/coffee-300x207.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Coffee Plantation, Singapore [Between 1890 and 1923] Prints and Photographs Division, //hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3b44053.&#xA0;</p></div>The International Coffee Agreement is still in effect today and includes more coffee-producing countries than the previous agreements, totaling <a href="http://www.ico.org/members_e.asp">43 exporting members</a>. The <a href="http://www.ico.org/icohistory_e.asp?section=About_Us">International Coffee Organization</a> states the major objective is &#8220;to strengthen the global coffee sector and promote its sustainable expansion in a market-based environment for the betterment of all participants in the sector.&#8221;</p> <p>Most of the world&#8217;s coffee comes from small farms in <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/should-we-continue-use-term-developing-world">developing countries</a> that have a specific climate suited to growing coffee.&#xA0;While there is no threat of war, as was the case when the Inter-American Coffee Agreement and the International Coffee Agreement were signed, the current International Coffee Agreement is still looking to aid developing countries, which are the main producers of coffee for the rest of the world, by helping them to sell the coffee they grow and produce.

Initially known as the International Union of American Republics, the Pan American Union became the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/about/who_we_are.asp">Organization of American States (OAS)</a> in 1948. The organization operates as a political cooperative body, establishing international treaties to promote democracy, human rights, security, and development.</p> <p>The document I came across was particularly interesting, as it was part of a House document that contained the Pan American Union&#8217;s report on public libraries in Latin America. The authors of this document highlighted specific libraries, along with their common interests and developments.</p> <div id="attachment_76019" style="width: 591px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="//blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/10/HHM1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-76019" src="//blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/10/HHM1-1024x536.jpg" alt="Photo of title page of Public Libraries in Latin American Countries bulletin.&#xA0;" width="581" height="304" srcset="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/10/HHM1-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/10/HHM1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/10/HHM1-768x402.jpg 768w, https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/10/HHM1.jpg 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Title page of Public Libraries in Latin American Countries bulletin.&#xA0;(H.

According to Eyquem, in 1538, the Universidad Imperial y Pontificia de Santo Domingo, the oldest university on the American continents, was founded by Spanish colonists. While &#8220;the first Spanish-American library is difficult to determine,&#8221; the library of the <a href="https://www.unc.edu.ar/">National University of C&#xF3;rdoba</a> is assumed to be the oldest. These libraries were open to &#8220;a comparatively small <em>elite</em>&#8221; &#8211; access was restricted to monks and university communities, the clergy, and the &#8220;well-to-do.&#8221; (H.

During <a href="https://www.grips.ac.jp/teacher/oono/hp/lecture_J/lec02.htm">the Edo period (1603-1868)</a>, people started&#xA0;<a href="https://www.pack-kimura.net/useful/packagingcontainer/article110459/">ordering food</a>&#xA0;on special occasions. In addition, vendors started to sell dishes, such as <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2344.html">grilled eel</a>, <a href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/tempura">tempura</a>, and <a href="https://matcha-jp.com/en/3018">soba noodles</a>, by carrying food on a pole and moving around towns and cities. After the <a href="https://www.soumu.go.jp/johotsusintokei/whitepaper/ja/s50/html/s50a01020201.html">telephone became widely used in the late 1960s</a>, <em>demae</em> became popular. <a href="https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%87%BA%E5%89%8D-576794"><em>Demae</em></a> means that, in accordance with the order, a restaurant prepares the dishes and delivers it to the ordering party. In 1985, Domino&#8217;s Pizza established its first shop for pizza delivery. Domino&#8217;s&#xA0;<a href="http://blog.fmk.fm/glory-old/2015/08/post-6828.php">dared to use the word &#8220;deribarii (delivery)&#8221;</a>, instead of <em>demae </em>to distinguish itself from traditional Japanese food delivery. As more pizza delivery competitors came into the market, <a href="https://www.ntt-card.com/trace/sp/vol61/special/page02.shtml">delivery of pizza became popular and common in Japan</a>. In recent years, food delivery has been expanded because <a href="https://medium.com/freshtrax-by-btrax/food-delivery-in-japan-1a887fb6cf69">food delivery service businesses that use smartphone applications</a>, such as Uber Eats, became widely used. And, of course, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Food-Beverage/Food-delivery-war-rages-amid-global-COVID-19-lockdowns">since the pandemic started, food delivery has expanded</a>&#xA0;even further.</p> <div id="attachment_75779" style="width: 386px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dshack/3098276920/in/photolist-nJRmap-r1k62U-nZJJXR-nRcevm-qWtzZL-fL4WDe-ooD2pc-pQNZGb-CbSK3-bcCpg6-7iEnrQ-iwFi1-piiA7-rbZmRq-CAvCqf-5KPzcZ-8Uo9vh-8Uo8SS-8UoadG-8bBUH9-bcCtBk-bcCyqT-bcCw5T-bcCBox-8xW1J6-7iAsyB-2jpFzS6-2jpFzku-YQbyvs-YQbxzj-2jpFzjC-YubiNj-2jpFzQn-2jpCLCx-2jpCLbL-2jpCLbW-YQby1u-2jpCLCs-2jpCLCh-dso4DE-9imrbv-5HMtMA-9ipxgC-9ipx1w"><img class="wp-image-75779" src="//blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/09/3098276920_bbf851cc70_o-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="212" srcset="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/09/3098276920_bbf851cc70_o-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/09/3098276920_bbf851cc70_o-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/09/3098276920_bbf851cc70_o-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Flickr user David Shackelford (Dec. 9, 2008), used under Creative Commons License, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/.</p></div> <p>Delivery service providers for cooked foods in Japan ride <a href="http://news.line.me/issue/oa-bengo4com/1iyqk9s478s3d">bicycles or mopeds of 125cc or less</a>. These are not made for speed, but stability. It appears, however, that there was a <a href="https://9post.tv/32311">national race among these delivery mopeds</a> that people found amusing. Riding mopeds exempts riders from the regulations under <a href="http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?id=1999&amp;vm=02&amp;re=02&amp;new=1">the Motor Truck Transportation Business Act</a>. The Act requires a person who wishes to manage a motor vehicle transportation business to obtain permission from, or notify the business to, the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) and follow the regulations. (Act No. 83 of 1989, amended by Act No. 96 of 2018, arts. 3, 35 &amp; 36.) A &#8220;light motor vehicle transportation business&#8221; is one to transport freight with light motor vehicles. However, mopeds of 125cc or less are not included in the definition of &#8220;light motor vehicles&#8221; in the Act. (Motor Truck Transportation Business Act art. 2, para. 4 &amp; 5; <a href="https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/search/elawsSearch/elaws_search/lsg0500/detail?lawId=401AC0000000083">Road Transport Vehicle Act</a>, Act No. 185 of 1951, amended by Act No. 14 of 2019 (Reiwa), art. 2, para. 2 &amp; 3; and <a href="https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/search/elawsSearch/elaws_search/lsg0500/detail?lawId=326M50000800074">Road Transport Vehicle Act Enforcement Rule</a>, Ministry of Transport Ordinance No. 74 of 1951, amended by MLIT Ordinance No. 33 of 2019 (Reiwa), art. 1.) Therefore, as long as a delivery service operator uses bicycles or mopeds of 125cc or less, the regulations do not apply. When a restaurant/cooking business delivers its own food to a customer, it is also not regarded as a motor vehicle transportation business. Therefore, the regulations do not apply either. (Motor Truck Transportation Business Act art. 2.)</p> <p>A four-wheel vehicle may be required for some food delivery. During the COVID-19 emergency period, some restaurants needed to use delivery services to deliver food to customers. In addition,&#xA0;<a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO59923630T00C20A6LB0000/">taxi drivers needed more work</a>. Taxis have passenger transport permissions, not freight transportation permissions. (<a href="https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/search/elawsSearch/elaws_search/lsg0500/detail?openerCode=1&amp;lawId=326AC0000000183_20200401_429AC0000000045">Road Transportation Act</a>, Act No. 183 of 1951, amended by Act No. 45 of 2017, arts. 4 &amp; 43; and <a href="http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?id=1999&amp;vm=02&amp;re=02&amp;new=1">Motor Truck Transportation Business Act</a>, Act No. 83 of 1989, amended by Act No. 96 of 2018, arts 3 &amp; 35.) On April 21, 2020, the MLIT notified local Transport Bureaus that it would allow taxi operators to transport freight under specific conditions until May 13. (<a href="https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/新型コロナウイルス感染拡大の影響を踏まえたタクシー事業者による有償貨物運送について">Regarding paid freight transportation by taxi operators based on the situation of the spread of the novel coronavirus infection</a>, MLIT Automobile Bureau Passenger &amp; Freight Div., Admin. Cir. (Apr. 21, 2020).) To receive special treatment under this circular, taxi business operators were required to make efforts to keep taxi drivers employed and to protect them from being infected with COVID-19 during the pandemic.<strong><span style="color: #ff00ff">&#xA0;</span></strong>They can transport food from restaurants that are affected by the pandemic. The food must be placed in the trunk, with some exceptions. (By the way, Japanese taxis&#8217; trunks are clean, and <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20200913/k10012615271000.html">even cleaner</a>&#xA0;if used for food delivery. See a couple of <a href="https://www.lmaga.jp/news/2020/05/119358/">photos</a>.) The service operation area is the same as their permitted passenger transport area. This exceptional measure <a href="https://wwwtb.mlit.go.jp/kanto/content/000162531.pdf">was extended a few times</a>, most recently until September 30, 2020.</p> <p>Food delivery by taxi <a href="https://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2020070700724&amp;g=eco">has been popular</a> among both taxi operators and users. The MLIT recognized delivery by taxi as a new successful business model, and last month decided to make it permanent. (<a href="https://www.mlit.go.jp/report/press/content/001362960.pdf">Handling of licenses for freight vehicle transportation business related to food and beverages by taxi operators</a>, Automobile Dept., MLIT, Auto-Safety No. 79, Auto-Passenger No. 201 &amp; Auto-Freight No. 37 of 2020 (Sept. 10, 2020).)</p> <p>While I was writing this article, I thought about the delicious sushi in Japan. I wish that a teleporting sushi-<em>demae</em> system could be developed in the near future. (Sushi must be delivered by <em>demae</em>. Deribarii (delivery) does not sound right.)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

After the war, he was elected to the newfound Cherokee National Council, acting as the primary English-speaking member of the tribe to communicate their needs to representatives of the United States government. In 1819, Ross was named <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/library/DigitalCollections/CherokeePhoenix/Vol1/no12/correspondence-page-2-column-1-2.html">President of the National Committee</a> (lower house of the Cherokee government) as he discussed his tribe&#8217;s inherited rights to Cherokee land with an acquisitive U.S. government (Inskeep, 97).</p> <p>The <a href="https://vault.georgiaarchives.org/digital/collection/adhoc/id/420/">Compact of 1802</a> had <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83020874/1831-04-09/ed-1/seq-1/">been established</a> 16 years prior to Ross&#8217;s appointment as the President of the National Committee.

After the <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/indian-removal-act?loclr=bloglaw">Indian Removal</a> <a href="https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=004/llsl004.db&amp;recNum=458?loclr=bloglaw">Act</a> passed in May 1830, Ross and the Cherokee people hired former <a href="https://www.archives.gov/nhprc/projects/catalog/william-wirt">Attorney General William Wirt</a>. <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2017/08/would-you-be-interested-in-getting-attorney-general-william-wirts-head-back-rebecca-roberts-brings-us-a-tale-from-the-congressional-cemetery/?loclr=bloglaw">Wirt</a> wrote his <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/american-indian-consts/PDF/10013932.pdf?loclr=bloglaw"><em>Opinion on the Right of the State of Georgia to Extend Her Laws Over the Cherokee Nation</em></a>, in which he argued that the Cherokee people should be considered a sovereign nation under the U.S. Constitution. Wirt represented the Cherokee in the 1831 U.S. court case, <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/30/1/"><em>Cherokee Nation v. Georgia</em></a>. Wirt and Ross argued that previous Cherokee treaties and Cherokee Nation sovereignty had been violated through the enactment of Georgia&#8217;s new laws. The court did not rule for Cherokee Nation; the court considered that Cherokee Nation was not a foreign nation and, thus, the court would not hear its complaints against Georgia.</p> <p>In 1835, while he was in D.C. and the Senate was offering Ross $5 million for the tribe to sell around 7 million acres, a posse called the Georgia Guard took his house (Inskeep, 208). The Georgia Guard also seized the printing press of the <em>Cherokee Phoenix</em> at New Echota in August 1835 and briefly took Ross prisoner in November (Inskeep, 208).</p> <p>Shortly afterward, while Ross was traveling again to D.C., Major Ridge, John Ridge and a few others signed the <a href="https://americanindian.si.edu/static/nationtonation/pdf/Treaty-of-New-Echota-1835.pdf">Treaty of New Echota</a> on December 29, 1835, accepting $5 million, minus various costs which the United States government charged the Cherokee government (Inskeep, 212). The Treaty Party, as the Ridges&#8217; group came to be called, were a small minority of the tribe&#8217;s members and not authorized to sign on behalf of the Cherokee. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-cherokees-vs-andrew-jackson-277394/">Ridge</a> seems to have acted because he thought it would save lives; he also got financial compensation for his substantial properties (Inskeep, 212). He and his son believed that signing the treaty without the tribe&#8217;s consent would probably <a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/this-land-episode-4-the-treaty/">cost them their lives</a>, and in fact they were correct.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=INDIAN%20REMOVAL">Cherokee removal</a> started in 1836, when Ridge and his cohort were marched out of Georgia, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/states/us-al.php?loclr=bloglaw">Alabama</a>, and other parts of the Cherokee homelands to <a href="https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=INDIAN%20TERRITORY">Indian Territory</a>. Many Cherokee remained in their <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2004633028/?loclr=bloglaw">homelands</a>, while the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042147/1838-06-06/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1789&amp;index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=AOartss+GENERAL+General+SCOTT+Scott+tnis&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1963&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=general+scott&amp;phrasetext=tnis+AOartss&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1">U.S. government</a> worked to remove them. The United States government marched approximately <a href="https://www.cherokee.org/about-the-nation/history/">16,000 Cherokees</a> in September or October from their homelands to Indian Territory. They left just before one of the worst winters on record. On the trip, <a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/this-land-episode-4-the-treaty/">one estimate found that one in four Cherokees died</a>; another estimate determined that the Cherokee population &#8220;may have been reduced by as many as eight thousand from what it otherwise would have been&#8221; (Inskeep, 236). It is unknown how many more died from the journey once they reached their destination <a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/this-land-episode-4-the-treaty/">950 miles and six months later</a>; it is now known as the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/trte/learn/historyculture/upload/The-Trail-Where-They-Cried-508.pdf">Trail of Tears</a>. The final detachment, composed of the elderly, ill and lame, left in December 1838, after a previous 13 detachments of a thousand people each (Moulton, 99-100).</p> <p>After the Cherokee started to settle in their new land, they argued with the federal government for years about their remuneration for the trip which the Treaty of New Echota guaranteed (Moulton, 101-104); their claim was not settled until 1841. John Ross worked to keep the Cherokee people united and was instrumental in the passage of their <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/06021615">new constitution in 1839</a>. He struggled for years save his people&#8217;s lands and their sovereignty and although they suffered many hardships, Ross and the Cherokee people succeeded in their ultimate goal: they are still here.</p> <p><strong><em>Sources</em></strong></p> <p>E382.I57 2015 Inskeep, Steve. <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2015300789"><em>Jacksonland: President Andrew Jackson, Cherokee Chief John Ross, and a great American land grab.</em></a> (2015)</p> <p>E99.C5 R675 Moulton, Gary E. <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/76001146"><em>John Ross, Cherokee Chief.</em></a> (1978)</p> <p>Nagle, Rebecca. <a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/this-land-episode-4-the-treaty"><em>The Treaty</em>.</a> [podcast] This Land, June 24, 2019.

    <p>The Law Library of Congress has had a long relationship with the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court of the United States</a> and its justices. Since the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/22nd-congress/session-1/c22s1ch221.pdf?loclr=bloglaw">Law Library&#8217;s founding in 1832</a>, the justices have had free access to the Law Library, and to this day, <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&amp;edition=prelim&amp;req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title2-section135&amp;f=treesort&amp;num=0&amp;saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjIgc2VjdGlvbjoxMzIgZWRpdGlvbjpwcmVsaW0pIE9SIChncmFudWxlaWQ6VVNDLXByZWxpbS10aXRsZTItc2VjdGlvbjEzMik%3D%7CdHJlZXNvcnQ%3D%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim">the chief justice has the authority to direct the purchases of the Law Library</a>. The Law Library is also one of <a href="//blogs.loc.gov/law/2012/04/a-new-volume-of-u-s-supreme-court-records-and-briefs-at-the-law-library-of-congress/?loclr=bloglaw">ten Supreme Court depository libraries</a> in the country, collecting the records and briefs submitted to the court as well as decisions issued by it. In light of this history, we thought we could best honor <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographyGinsburg.aspx">Supreme Court Associate Justice Ginsburg&#8217;s</a> life by providing information on the items in our collections by and about the Justice.</p> <p>The place to begin finding works by and about Justice Ginsburg is through the <a href="https://catalog.loc.gov/?loclr=bloglaw">Library&#8217;s catalog</a>. We first searched for her as an <a href="https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/searchBrowse?loclr=bloglaw">author</a> and found a number of items in the Library&#8217;s collection. Her three earliest works are on <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/sweden.php?loclr=bloglaw">Swedish law</a>. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dead.html">her New York Times obituary noted</a>, Justice Ginsburg spent seven years in the 1960s working on a comparative law project at <a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/">Columbia University Law School</a>. The first book produced in this project was <em><a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/65006184">Civil Procedure in Sweden</a></em>, co-authored by Anders Bruzelius and published in 1965. A note on the catalog record states that the book is the &#8220;First of a series to be prepared by the Project on International Procedure of the Columbia University School of Law.&#8221;</p> <p>The second book Justice Ginsburg worked on was <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/73002707"><em>The Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure</em></a>. Justice Ginsburg and co-author Bruzelius translated this code from Swedish into English as part of another series, <a href="https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=TALL&amp;searchArg=American+series+of+foreign+penal+codes&amp;searchType=1&amp;limitTo=none&amp;fromYear=&amp;toYear=&amp;limitTo=LOCA%3Dall&amp;limitTo=PLAC%3Dall&amp;limitTo=TYPE%3Dall&amp;limitTo=LANG%3Dall&amp;recCount=25">The American Series of Foreign Penal Codes</a>. Her <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/77118020">third book</a> was on Scandinavian law, but by 1974 her work pivoted to U.S. law and issues of sex discrimination. In 1974, she co-authored a textbook, <em><a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/74000091">Text, Cases and Materials on Sex-based Discrimination</a></em>. The first chapter of this book, which was written by Justice Ginsburg, was published simultaneously as a <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/74004512">separate, shorter work</a>. Later books by Justice Ginsburg include more autobiographical material such as <em><a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2016031635">My Own Words</a></em>, but in keeping with her early interests in the laws of other countries, she also wrote a foreword to a book about <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2012011594">German constitutional jurisprudence</a>.</p> <p>During the 1970s, Justice Ginsburg became head of the ACLU&#8217;s Women&#8217;s Rights Project. In this position, she wrote briefs and argued cases for the ACLU before the U.S. Supreme Court. These cases include <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep404/usrep404071/usrep404071.pdf"><em>Reed v. Reed</em> 404 U.S. 71</a>, <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep411/usrep411677/usrep411677.pdf"><em>Frontiero v. Richardson</em>, 411 U.S. 677</a>, and <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep439/usrep439357/usrep439357.pdf"><em>Duren v. Missouri</em>, 439 U.S. 357</a>. <em>Duren</em> was the last case she argued before the Supreme Court before being appointed as a judge to the <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit</a>.&#xA0; <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/drawing-justice-courtroom-illustrations/about-this-exhibition/race-based-crimes/women-serving-on-juries/?loclr=bloglaw">A page of her notes</a> in preparation of oral argument in <em>Duren</em> was part of the Library&#8217;s <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/drawing-justice-courtroom-illustrations/about-this-exhibition/?loclr=bloglaw">Drawing Justice exhibit</a>. The text of the briefs written by Justice Ginsburg are part of our Supreme Court depository collection. They are available in <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/92644396">print</a> and <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/find/microtext.php?loclr=bloglaw">microfiche</a> and can be ordered in the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/visit/readingroom/index.php?loclr=bloglaw">Law Library&#8217;s Reading Room&#xA0;</a>when we reopen. The Law Library of Congress also has in its collections transcripts for <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/87656708">oral</a> <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/88661996">arguments</a> before the Supreme Court. The Law Library has a <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/supreme-court-records-and-briefs?loclr=bloglaw">research guide</a>&#xA0;that provides more detailed information about locating Supreme Court records and briefs and oral argument transcripts.</p> <p>In 1980, Justice Ginsburg was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, followed in 1993 by her appointment to the <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/91108862">Supreme Court</a>. Much of her work in these years can be found in the decisions she wrote as a judge. The Law Library holds texts of the published decisions, with the appellate decisions in the <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/99004395">Federal</a> <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/79641716">Reporter</a> and the Supreme Court decisions in the <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/01026074">United States (U.S.) Reports</a>. The Law Library has digitized the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/us-reports.php?loclr=bloglaw">U.S. Reports</a> and made it possible to retrieve <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/united-states-reports/?fa=contributor%3Aginsburg%2C+ruth+bader">all the decisions</a> written by a justice. The Law Library has created a guide, <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/free-case-law?loclr=bloglaw">How to Find Free Case Law Online</a>,&#xA0;which can be used to search for appellate court decisions crafted by Justice Ginsburg.</p> <p>As well as being an author of various books, Justice Ginsburg is also the subject of materials found across the Library&#8217;s collections, including <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2017932855">children&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2017949440">books</a>,&#xA0;<a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=ruth%20bader%20ginsburg&amp;sg=true">drawings and photographs</a>&#xA0;, <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2019619172">a musical recording</a>, <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2020603083">a movie</a>, and even a <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2019218878">comic book</a>. She also featured in the Law Library&#8217;s blog several times.&#xA0;The first instance was the <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2010/11/an-interview-with-pamela-barnes-craig/?loclr=bloglaw">description of a tour</a>&#xA0;given by our former colleague Pamela Barnes Craig to the Justice. A more recent blog was about a <a href="//blogs.loc.gov/law/2017/07/justice-for-shylock-a-mock-appeal/?loclr=bloglaw">mock appeal of Shylock</a>&#xA0;at which she presided in June 2017. And the <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/national-book-festival/?loclr=bloglaw">Library&#8217;s National Book Festival blog</a> covered her <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/national-book-festival/2020/04/best-of-the-national-book-festival-u-s-supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-2019/?loclr=bloglaw">participation in last year&#8217;s</a> National Book Festival.</p> <p>We must caution that the <a href="https://loc.gov/?loclr=bloglaw">Library is still closed to the public</a>. However, we hope that when we reopen, you will visit the Law Library and other Library research centers to explore our varied collections by and about Justice Ginsburg.</p>

    <p>The permeation of misinformation and disinformation relating to any conceivable issue, particularly on social media platforms, is <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/social-media/social-media-misinformation-policies/">rampant</a>. This problem has become particularly acute with the advent of the <a href="//blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/03/coronavirus-resource-guide/?loclr=bloglaw">COVID-19</a> global pandemic. A policy document issued by the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OCED)&#xA0;<a href="http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/combatting-covid-19-disinformation-on-online-platforms-d854ec48/">described</a>&#xA0;the ubiquity of false information and the challenge it presents in fighting the pandemic as follows:</p> <blockquote><p><a id="p-d1e102" class="web_offset"></a><span id="indx-1#p-d1e102" class="web_search-marked">The harmful effects of disinformation about COVID-19 cannot be overstated. </span><span id="indx-2#p-d1e102" class="web_search-marked">Data</span><span id="indx-3#p-d1e102" class="web_search-marked"> from Argentina, Germany, Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States show that about one in three people say they have seen false or misleading COVID-19-related information on social media. </span><span id="indx-4#p-d1e102" class="web_search-marked">Research</span><span id="indx-5#p-d1e102" class="web_search-marked"> has also shown that COVID-19 disinformation is disseminated significantly more widely than information about the virus from authoritative sources like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By calling into question official sources and data and convincing people to try bogus treatments, the spread of dis- and misinformation has led people to ingest fatal home cures, ignore social distancing and lockdown rules, and not to wear protective masks, thereby undermining the effectiveness of containment strategies. </span></p></blockquote> <p>While some countries have focused more on <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/countering-misinformation-about-covid-19">awareness campaigns</a>&#xA0;to counter this problem, others have gone further.

The limitations vary in form and severity, ranging from restrictions on media freedoms (including censorship of content relating to the pandemic and restrictions on movements of journalists); to amendments of criminal laws banning dissemination of false information, including through social medial platforms; to the use of existing laws that bar the spread of information to make arrests and pursue prosecutions; to changing laws relating to mass media and internet resources to hold accountable communications network operators. The consequences of violations of such restrictions also vary widely.</p> <p>The report found that, in a few jurisdictions, pressure campaigns forced governments to scale back restrictions on freedom of expression. In a couple of jurisdictions, the restrictions survived challenges in court.</p> <p>If you are interested in more pandemic related issues, please take a look at two other reports the Law Library published recently: <em><a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/coronavirus-apps/index.php?loclr=bloglaw">Regulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19</a> </em>and&#xA0;<em><a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/wet-markets/index.php?loclr=bloglaw">Regulation of Wild Animal Wet Markets</a></em>.

    <p>On September 10, 2020, the Library held its first ever <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/08/announcing-a-congress-gov-virtual-public-forum-on-september-10th/?loclr=bloglaw">Congress.gov Public Forum</a> to update the public on the work the Library of Congress and its data partners are doing to improve access to legislative information, and more importantly, to listen to your suggestions on how we can better serve your legislative information needs.</p> <p>The Librarian of Congress, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/about/about-the-librarian/?loclr=bloglaw">Dr. Carla Hayden</a>, and the Library&#8217;s chief information officer, Bud Barton, provided welcoming remarks. <a href="//blogs.loc.gov/law/author/rbram/?loclr=bloglaw">Robert Brammer</a> provided an overview of Congress.gov updates for the past year, and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/?loclr=bloglaw">Congress.gov</a>&#xA0;product owner, <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/author/anwe/?loclr=bloglaw">Andrew Weber</a>, provided an update on upcoming Congress.gov features. This presentation was followed by a 20-minute question and answer period moderated by the digital strategy director for the Library of Congress, <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/author/kzwa/?loclr=bloglaw">Kate Zwaard</a>.</p> <p>Congress.gov aggregates legislative data, so the development of new features depends on the hard work of our data partners, particularly the <a href="http://www.house.gov">House</a>, the&#xA0;<a href="http://www.senate.gov">Senate</a>, the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/?loclr=bloglaw">Congressional Budget Office</a>, and the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov">Government Publishing Office</a>&#xA0;(GPO). For our next presentation, the forum featured a panel that discussed data modernization efforts that was moderated by Kimberly Ferguson from the Library&#8217;s Congress.gov team.&#xA0;Matt Landgraf, a lead program manager for the GPO&#xA0;XPub initiative, and Lisa LaPlant, the program manager for the GPO site&#xA0;<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/">GovInfo</a>, discussed GPO&#8217;s data modernization initiatives, including <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/who-we-are/news-media/news-and-press-releases/gpo-produces-US-code-with-new-digital-publishing-technology">XPub</a>, <a href="https://github.com/usgpo/uslm/blob/master/USLM-User-Guide.md">USLM</a> (United States Legislative Markup), and updates to GovInfo. Kirsten Gullickson, a principal analyst for legislative computer systems at the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/">Office of Clerk of the United States House of Representatives</a>, discussed legacy data modernization efforts, how the Clerk of the House exchanges data with Congress.gov, and how that exchange of data also supplies the Clerk&#8217;s&#xA0;<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/">new homepage</a>. The panel, including&#xA0;Arin Shapiro, a webmaster and director of web technology from the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/reference/office/secretary_of_senate.htm">Office of the Secretary for the United States Senate</a>, then answered questions concerning data modernization for 30 minutes.&#xA0;The Data Modernization panel&#8217;s consistent message is that implementing data standards and tools to help clerks support data standards are critical to increased efficiency, transparency, and interoperability for Congressional documents (see <a href="https://modernizecongress.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Adopting%20Standardized%20Formats%20for%20Legislative%20Documents.pdf">Adopting Standardized Formats for Legislative Documents</a> for more information).</p> <p>The final round of presentations consisted of lightning talks. Erin Hromada, from the <a href="https://history.house.gov/?loclr=bloglaw">Office of the Historian for the United States House of Representatives</a>, discussed the work to improve the <a href="https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/?loclr=bloglaw">Congressional Bioguide</a>. Jeanne Dennis, the acting assistant director of the American Law Division of the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/?loclr=bloglaw">Congressional Research Service</a>, provided an update on the <em><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/?loclr=bloglaw">Constitution Annotated.</a>&#xA0;</em><a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/author/jgon/?loclr=bloglaw">Jennifer Gonzalez</a>, a legal information specialist in the Law Library of Congress Digital Resources Division, discussed the Law Library&#8217;s work to digitize and describe the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/?loclr=bloglaw">United States Statutes at Large</a>, along with her coordination of <a href="//blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/07/remote-interns-for-summer-2020/?loclr=bloglaw">remote metadata interns</a> located across the country who have made this effort possible.&#xA0;Jay Sweany, the chief of the Law Library of Congress Digital Resources Division, provided an update on the Law Library&#8217;s effort to digitize the <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2019/10/library-of-congress-and-u-s-government-publishing-office-digitizing-u-s-congressional-serial-set/?loclr=bloglaw">United States Serial Set</a>.</p> <p>After the lightning talks concluded, we held a listening session for 60 minutes where we answered questions and listened to suggestions from the audience. Jim Karamanis, the Director of I.T. Design and Development at the Library of Congress Office of the Chief Information Officer, provided closing remarks.</p> <p>We would like to thank everyone who participated in the public forum or who submitted feedback through the feedback form on Congress.gov. User feedback has driven many of the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/about/enhancements/?loclr=bloglaw">enhancements</a> to Congress.gov, so please keep your suggestions coming through the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/help#survey">survey form</a>. Also,&#xA0;since mobile devices now account for half of all Congress.gov traffic, we would appreciate it if you would <a href="https://www.research.net/r/cdg-mobile-usage-survey">share your thoughts</a> on mobile use of the site.</p> <p>Suggestions received from the audience during the forum included enhancing existing Congress.gov data collections with new features, adding new collections to Congress.gov, and linking existing collections of data together.

    Unlike most countries,&#xA0;Austria&#xA0;does not have just one constitutional document, like the Constitution of the United States for example, but several documents that have constitutional status. Of these documents, the most important one is the&#xA0;Austrian Federal Constitutional Law (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz).&#xA0;It was adopted by the Constituent National Assembly on October 1, 1920&#8212;100 years ago today&#8212;and entered into force [&#8230;]

    <p>Unlike most countries,&#xA0;<a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/austria.php?loclr=bloglaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Austria</a>&#xA0;does not have just one constitutional document, like the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/?loclr=bloglaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constitution</a> of the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/federal.php?loclr=bloglaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a> for example, but several documents that have constitutional status.

It was amended in 1925 and 1929, and rendered <a href="https://www.wien.gv.at/english/history/commemoration/staendestaat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inoperative</a> in 1934. In 1945, after the end of <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ww2/?loclr=bloglaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World War II</a>, the Federal Constitutional Law&#xA0;was reinstated. The Federal Constitutional Law established the Austrian State as a federal republic with a <a href="https://www.v4dplplus.eu/history-404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong bicameral parliament</a> and set out the basic structure of the state, democracy, and the courts.</p> <div id="attachment_75685" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?aid=bgb&amp;datum=19200004&amp;seite=00000001"><img class="wp-image-75685" src="//blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/09/Gesetz-vom-1.-Oktober-1920_-womit-die-Republik-&#xD6;sterreich-als-Bundesstaat-eingerichtet-wird.jpg-733x1024.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="805" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">First page of the Federal Constitutional Law of Oct. 1, 1920, as published in the Austrian Federal Law Gazette.</p></div> <p><strong>Debate of the Draft Constitution in the Constituent National Assembly</strong></p> <p>The university professor, legal philosopher, and jurist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Kelsen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hans Kelsen</a>, also known as the <a href="https://oe99.staatsarchiv.at/20-jh/die-kelsen-verfassung/#c1565" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Father of the Austrian Constitution,&#8221;</a>&#xA0;had been tasked in 1919 by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Renner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karl Renner</a>, the then-chancellor of the Austrian republic, to produce a draft constitutional text. The deliberations with the provinces and in the Constituent National Assembly took more than a year and the draft was revised multiple times. In particular, the division of powers between the federation and the provinces&#xA0;<a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/ENGL/PERK/HIS/REP1/1918-1920/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proved controversial</a>. Kelsen&#8217;s influence in the final version of the Federal Constitutional Law is <a href="https://oe99.staatsarchiv.at/20-jh/die-kelsen-verfassung/#c1565" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly noticeable</a> in the rules on the composition of the <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/ENGL/PERK/NRBRBV/BR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Council</a> (Bundesrat), whose members were delegated by the provinces and represented the latter&#8217;s interests, and the establishment of the <a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/verfassungsgerichtshof/100Jahre/100_Jahre_Verfassungsgerichtshof.de.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Constitutional Court</a> with the power to <a href="https://oxcon.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law-mpeccol/law-mpeccol-e334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review the constitutionality</a> of legislation. <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/ENGL/PERK/HIS/REP1/1918-1920/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On some issues</a>, such as the fiscal constitution, the organization of administrative services in the provinces, and competences regarding schools and education in general, no compromise could be achieved, and they were dealt with in the 1925 amendment. The amendment of 1929 strengthened the role of the <a href="https://www.austria.org/the-federal-president" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal president</a>,&#xA0;providing that he be directly elected by the people instead of by both houses of parliament (<a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/ENGL/PERK/NRBRBV/BV/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Assembly</a>).</p> <p><strong>Bill of Rights</strong></p> <p>Another controversial topic was the inclusion of a comprehensive bill of rights. As no agreement on a new catalog of rights could be reached, the representatives decided to adopt the&#xA0;rights enshrined in the <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1867_142/ERV_1867_142.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals of 1867</a>. (<a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1930_1/ERV_1930_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Constitutional Law</a>, art. 149.) There are a few isolated provisions in the Federal Constitutional Law that grant civil and political rights and procedural guarantees. After Austria joined the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Council of Europe</a>&#xA0;in 1955, the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_Eng.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</a>&#xA0;and its <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/echr-toolkit/protocole-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first additional protocol</a> were awarded <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblPdf/1964_59_0/1964_59_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">constitutional law status in 1964</a>. The rights codified in the ECHR are <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/pages/whatarehumanrights.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human rights</a> and are granted to everyone, whereas those contained in the Basic Law of 1867 and the Federal Constitutional Law are mostly <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Vfgh/JFT_09899390_09B00887_00/JFT_09899390_09B00887_00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">citizen rights</a>, meaning they are granted to Austrians and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A12008E018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU citizens</a> only.</p> <p><strong>Parliament</strong></p> <p>The Federal Constitutional Law of 1920 established a strong bicameral parliament, composed of the <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/ENGL/PERK/NRBRBV/NR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Council</a>&#xA0;(Nationalrat), whose members are directly elected by the people for a period of four years, and the Federal Council (Bundesrat). (Federal Constitutional Law,&#xA0;arts. 24, 34.) The Federal Constitutional Law provided that the federal government be elected by the National Council and depended on its confidence. (Id. arts. 70, 74.) In addition, the federal president was to be elected by the Federal Assembly, meaning jointly by the National Council and the Federal Council. The first federal president, the independent jurist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Arthur-Josef-Jakob-Hainisch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Hainisch</a>, was elected in December 1920. In 1929, an amendment to the Federal Constitutional Law provided that the federal president henceforth be directly elected by the people.

At the time, such a specialized constitutional court was unique, only&#xA0;the <a href="https://www.usoud.cz/en/constitutional-court-of-the-czechoslovak-republic-and-its-fortunes-in-years-1920-1948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then-Czechoslovak Republic</a> had established one. (Id. at 30.) In the second half of the 20th century, the <a href="https://www.venice.coe.int/SACJF/2006_02_Venice_Strasbourg/report_mazak.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Austrian model&#8221;</a> inspired many countries to adopt similar models, such as the <a href="https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/EN/Das-Gericht/Aufgaben/aufgaben_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Constitutional Court</a> in <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/germany.php?loclr=bloglaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany</a>. The 1925 and 1929 amendments strengthened the powers of the court and changed the modalities for the appointment of judges in an effort to &#8220;depoliticize&#8221; the process. (Id.) The amendments prohibited the appointment of members of federal or state governments or members of parliament to the court. Half of the members are proposed by the federal government and the other half by the two houses of parliament. (Federal Constitutional Law, art. 147, paras. 2, 4.)</p> <div id="attachment_75736" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/medien/pressefotos.de.html"><img class="size-large wp-image-75736" src="//blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/09/VfGH-gebaeude1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/09/VfGH-gebaeude1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/09/VfGH-gebaeude1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2020/09/VfGH-gebaeude1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Constitutional Court building. &#xA9;VfGH/Achim Bieniek</p></div> <p>Throughout this year, the Austrian Federal Constitutional Court is <a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/verfassungsgerichtshof/100Jahre/100_Jahre_Verfassungsgerichtshof.de.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrating</a> the 100th anniversary of the Federal Constitutional Law with a lecture series on the constitution and the Court.
